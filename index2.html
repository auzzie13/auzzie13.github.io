                <p>Hello.  My name is Austin Williams.  I was born in Jacksonville, Fl and moved to Spring Hill, TN in sixth grade.  I attended Middle Tennessee State University, and majored in athletic training.  Since graduation, I have worked in all levels of sport, from the NFL, NCAA football, USL, and high school.  Fun fact:  my first job was in Birmingham, Al where I covered a local high school called Hueytown.  At Hueytown, we had a junior quarterback named Jameis Winston-some may have heard of him.  Most recently I was the clinical coordinator of event medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  In this role, I oversaw a staff of 25 part-time athletic trainers.  We were contracted with over 40 teams, leagues, schools, etc. that requested sports medicine coverage.  I would staff as well as provide equipment and supplies, for all events.  My wife and I were married in 2013 and moved to Nashville.  We have a two year old daughter.  I love all things sports.  I am a die hard Florida Gators and Jacksonville Jaguars fan.  I enjoy playing golf, being outside, going to concerts, and spending time with friends and family.  Coding school, thus far, has been a huge challenge, but enjoying the process and work that goes into it.  I look forward to growing with everyone over these next 3 months.</p>
