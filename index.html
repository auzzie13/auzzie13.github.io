            <p>Hello.  My name is Austin Williams.  I was born in Jacksonville, Fl and moved to Spring Hill, TN in sixth grade.  I attended Middle Tennessee State University, and majored in athletic training.  Since graduation, I have worked in all levels of sport, from the National Football League, NCAA football, United Soccer League, to high school. Most recently I was the clinical coordinator of event medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.  In this role, I oversaw a staff of 25 part-time athletic trainers and coordinated coverage for over 40 teams, leagues, schools, etc. that requested sports medicine services.  My wife and I were married in 2013, moved to Nashville, and been there ever since.  We have a two year old daughter.  I love all things sports, playing golf, being outside, going to concerts, and spending time with friends and family.  Coding school, thus far, has been a huge challenge, but enjoying the process and work that goes into it.  I look forward to growing with everyone over these next 3 months.</p>
